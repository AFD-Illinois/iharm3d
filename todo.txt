TEST PROBLEMS TO RUN

Check:
    2nd-order (or a bit higher initially) convergence w/self
    Record runtimes for posterity

1. Hydrodynamic equilibrium, no B field
    Set B=0 in torus/problem.c and anywhere found
    Should not deviate
    Run for a couple crossing times, as default -- 500-1000M

2. Bondi flow w/monopolar magnetic field from BH
    About 1 light-crossing

3. Bhlight-specific stuff:
    Ben's auto-checker for linear modes (run about 1-2 crossing time)    
    Ask about this if unclear

4. Orzag-Tang conditions from 2D set (or in 3D stuff?)
    Ask for interpretation help

Reconstruction notes:
    PPM Reconstruction is dicey -- possibly unstable, not working well for anyone
    Instead, substitute WENO (WINO?) reconstruction
    Se reconstruction.c for details on this, ask if unclear
