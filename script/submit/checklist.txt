HARM run checklist:

1. Check loaded modules: only GCC and Intel 18.0.0 specifically are supported currently
2. make -f /path/to/iharm3d/makefile PROB=torus (or whatever) to obtain local build archive
3. modify build_archive/parameters.h with at least:
	* Number of zones in each direction
	* Number of processes in each dir (total 4x desired number of nodes for optimal efficiency)
	* Reconstruction type
	* Floor parameters
4. make -f /path/to/iharm3d/makefile PROB=torus
5. copy in desired param.dat and modify as necessary, probably at least:
	* a
	* mad_type
6. sbatch -N (nodes) -p (queue) /path/to/iharm.sb
