	abstract = {Recent developments in compact object astrophysics, especially the discovery of merging neutron stars by LIGO, the imaging of the black hole in M87 by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and high precision astrometry of the Galactic Center at close to the event horizon scale by the GRAVITY experiment motivate the development of numerical source models that solve the equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). Here we compare GRMHD solutions for the evolution of a magnetized accretion flow where turbulence is promoted by the magnetorotational instability from a set of nine GRMHD codes: Athena++, BHAC, Cosmos++, ECHO, H-AMR, iharm3D, HARM-Noble, IllinoisGRMHD and KORAL. Agreement between the codes improves as resolution increases, as measured by a consistently applied, specially developed set of code performance metrics. We conclude that the community of GRMHD codes is mature, capable, and consistent on these test problems.},

	abstract = {This review covers the main aspects of black hole accretion disk theory. We begin with the view that one of the main goals of the theory is to better understand the nature of black holes themselves. In this light we discuss how accretion disks might reveal some of the unique signatures of strong gravity: the event horizon, the innermost stable circular orbit, and the ergosphere. We then review, from a first-principles perspective, the physical processes at play in accretion disks. This leads us to the four primary accretion disk models that we review: Polish doughnuts (thick disks), Shakura-Sunyaev (thin) disks, slim disks, and advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). After presenting the models we discuss issues of stability, oscillations, and jets. Following our review of the analytic work, we take a parallel approach in reviewing numerical studies of black hole accretion disks. We finish with a few select applications that highlight particular astrophysical applications: measurements of black hole mass and spin, black hole vs. neutron star accretion disks, black hole accretion disk spectral states, and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).},

	abstract = {A numerical scheme is described for including radiation in multidimensional general relativistic conservative fluid dynamics codes. In this method, a covariant form of the M1 closure scheme is used to close the radiation moments, and the radiative source terms are treated semi-implicitly in order to handle both optically thin and optically thick regimes. The scheme has been implemented in a conservative general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics code KORAL. The robustness of the code is demonstrated on a number of test problems, including radiative relativistic shock tubes, static radiation pressure supported atmosphere, shadows, beams of light in curved space-time and radiative Bondi accretion. The advantages of M1 closure relative to other approaches such as the Eddington closure and flux-limited diffusion are discussed, and its limitations are also highlighted.},

	doi = {10.1093/mnras/stt2479},
	abstract = {A new general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamical code KORAL is described, which employs the M1 scheme to close the radiation moment equations. The code has been successfully verified against a number of tests. Axisymmetric simulations of super-critical magnetized accretion on non-rotating (a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.0) and spinning (a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.9) black holes are presented. The accretion rates in the two models are dot\{M\}≈ 100-200 dot\{M\}\_Edd. These first general relativistic simulations of super-critical black hole accretion are potentially relevant to tidal disruption events and hyper-accreting supermassive black holes in the early Universe. Both simulated models are optically and geometrically thick, and have funnels through which energy escapes in the form of relativistic gas, Poynting flux and radiative flux. The jet is significantly more powerful in the a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.9 run. The net energy outflow rate in the two runs correspond to efficiencies of 5 per cent (a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0) and 33 per cent (a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.9), as measured with respect to the mass accretion rate at the black hole. These efficiencies agree well with those measured in previous simulations of non-radiative geometrically thick discs. Furthermore, in the a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.9 run, the outflow power appears to originate in the spinning black hole, suggesting that the associated physics is again similar in non-radiative and super-critical accretion flows. While the two simulations are efficient in terms of total energy outflow, both runs are radiatively inefficient. Their luminosities are only ̃1-10L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Edd{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, which corresponds to a radiative efficiency ̃0.1 per cent. Interestingly, most of the radiative luminosity emerges through the funnels where the local radiative flux is highly super-Eddington.},

compare the results for polarised thin accretion disc and semi-analytic

Along the way, we provide accurate fitting functions for polarised
synchrotron emission and transfer coefficients from thermal and
power-law distribution functions, and compare results from numerical
integration and quadrature solutions of the polarised radiative transfer
equations. We also show that all transfer coefficients can play an
important role in predicted images and polarisation maps of the Galactic

	abstract = {Black hole accretion flows can be divided into two broad classes: cold and hot. Whereas cold accretion flows consist of cool optically thick gas and are found at relatively high mass accretion rates, hot accretion flows, the topic of this review, are virially hot and optically thin, and occur at lower mass accretion rates. They are described by accretion solutions such as the advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow. Because of energy advection, the radiative efficiency of these flows is in general lower than that of a standard thin accretion disk. Moreover, the efficiency decreases with decreasing mass accretion rate. Observations show that hot accretion flows are associated with jets. In addition, theoretical arguments suggest that hot flows should produce strong winds. Hot accretion flows are believed to be present in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and in black hole X-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states. The prototype is Sgr A*, the ultralow-luminosity supermassive black hole at our Galactic center. The jet, wind, and radiation from a supermassive black hole with a hot accretion flow can interact with the external interstellar medium and modify the evolution of the host galaxy.},

magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) require a method for transforming between
``conserved'' variables such as momentum and energy density and
``primitive'' variables such as rest-mass density, internal energy, and
components of the four-velocity. The forward transformation (primitive
to conserved) has a closed-form solution, but the inverse transformation
(conserved to primitive) requires the solution of a set of five
nonlinear equations. Here we discuss the mathematical properties of the
inverse transformation and present six numerical methods for performing
the inversion. The first method solves the full set of five nonlinear
equations directly using a Newton-Raphson scheme and a guess from the
previous time step. The other methods reduce the five nonlinear
equations to either one or two nonlinear equations that are solved
numerically. Comparisons between the methods are made using a survey
over phase space, a two-dimensional explosion problem, and a general
relativistic MHD accretion disk simulation. The run time of the methods
is also examined. Code implementing the schemes is available with the
electronic edition of the article.},

	abstract = {Seven schemes to maintain the ∇·B=0 constraint numerically are compared. All these algorithms can be combined with shock-capturing Godunov type base schemes. They fall into three categories: the eight-wave formulation maintains the constraint to truncation error, the projection scheme enforces the constraint in some discretization by projecting the magnetic field, while the five different versions of the constrained transport/central difference type schemes conserve ∇·B to machine accuracy in some discretization for every grid cell. It is shown that the three constrained transport algorithms, which have been introduced recently, can be recast into pure finite volume schemes, and the staggered representation of the magnetic field is unnecessary. Another two new and simple central difference based algorithms are introduced. The properties of the projection scheme are discussed in some detail, and I prove that it has the same order of accuracy as the base scheme even for discontinuous solutions. I describe a flexible and efficient implementation of the projection scheme using conjugate gradient type iterative methods. Generalizations to resistive MHD, to axial symmetry, and to non-Cartesian grids are given for all schemes. The theoretical discussion is followed by numerical tests, where the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the seven schemes and the base scheme can be directly compared. All simulations are done with the Versatile Advection Code, in which several shock-capturing base schemes are implemented. Although the eight-wave formulation usually works correctly, one of the numerical tests demonstrates that its non-conservative nature can occasionally produce incorrect jumps across strong discontinuities. Based on a large number of tests, the projection scheme, one of the new central difference based schemes, and one of the constrained transport schemes are found to be the most accurate and reliable among the examined methods.},

BHAC has been designed to solve the equations of ideal general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in arbitrary spacetimes and exploits adaptive mesh refinement techniques with an efficient block-based approach. Several spacetimes have already been implemented and tested. We demonstrate the validity of BHAC by means of various one-, two-, and three-dimensional test problems, as well as through a close comparison with the HARM3D code in the case of a torus accreting onto a black hole. The convergence of a turbulent accretion scenario is investigated with several diagnostics and we find accretion rates and horizon-penetrating fluxes to be convergent to within a few percent when the problem is run in three dimensions. Our analysis also involves the study of the corresponding thermal synchrotron emission, which is performed by means of a new general-relativistic radiative transfer code, BHOSS. The resulting synthetic intensity maps of accretion onto black holes are found to be convergent with increasing resolution and are anticipated to play a crucial role in the interpretation of horizon-scale images resulting from upcoming radio observations of the source at the Galactic Center.},

the emission favoured by previous phenomenological analytic and
numerical works. More specifically, we find that the low frequency radio
emission is dominated by emission from a polar outflow while the
emission above 100 GHz is dominated by the inner region of the accretion
disc. The latter produces time variable near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray
emission, with frequent flaring events (including IR flares without
corresponding X-ray flares and IR flares with weak X-ray flares). The
photon ring is clearly visible at 230 GHz and 2 μm, which is
encouraging for future horizon-scale observations. We also show that
anisotropic electron thermal conduction along magnetic field lines has a
negligible effect on the radiative properties of our model. We conclude
by noting limitations of our current generation of first-principles
models, particularly that the outflow is closer to adiabatic than
isothermal and thus underpredicts the low frequency radio emission.},

magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of advection-dominated
accretion around a non-spinning black hole. The first simulation was
designed to avoid significant accumulation of magnetic flux around the
black hole. This simulation was run for a time of 200 000
GM/c3 and achieved inflow equilibrium out to a radius
˜90 GM/c2. Even at this relatively large radius, the
mass outflow rate M⊙ out is found to be only 60 per cent of the net
mass inflow rate M⊙ BH into the black hole. The second simulation
was designed to achieve substantial magnetic flux accumulation around
the black hole in a magnetically arrested disc. This simulation was run
for a shorter time of 100 000 GM/c3. Nevertheless, because
the mean radial velocity was several times larger than in the first
simulation, it reached inflow equilibrium out to a radius ˜170
GM/c2. Here, M⊙ out becomes equal to M⊙ BH at r ˜
160 GM/c2. Since the mass outflow rates in the two simulations do
not show robust convergence with time, it is likely that the true
outflow rates are lower than our estimates. The effect of black hole
spin on mass outflow remains to be explored. Neither simulation shows
strong evidence for convection, though a complete analysis including the
effect of magnetic fields is left for the future.},

While the original image was constructed from measurements of the total intensity, full polarimetric data were also collected, and linear polarimetric images are expected in the near future. We propose a modal image decomposition of the linear polarization field into basis functions with varying azimuthal dependence of the electric vector position angle. We apply this decomposition to images of ray traced general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the Messier 87 accretion disk. For simulated images that are physically consistent with previous observations, the magnitude of the coefficient associated with rotational symmetry, \${\textbackslash}beta\_2\$, is a useful discriminator between accretion states. We find that at 20 \${\textbackslash}mu\$as resolution, \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}beta\_2{\textbar}\$ is greater than 0.2 only for models of disks with horizon-scale magnetic pressures large enough to disrupt steady accretion. We also find that images with a more radially directed electric vector position angle correspond to models with higher black hole spin. Our analysis demonstrates the utility of the proposed decomposition as a diagnostic framework to improve constraints on theoretical models.},

Modeling these systems realistically is a central problem in theoretical astrophysics, but has proven extremely challenging, requiring the development of numerical relativity codes that solve Einstein's equations for the spacetime, coupled to the equations of general relativistic (ideal) magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) for the magnetized fluids. Over the past decade, the Illinois numerical relativity (ILNR) group's dynamical spacetime GRMHD code has proven itself as a robust and reliable tool for theoretical modeling of such GRMHD phenomena. However, the code was written ‘by experts and for experts’ of the code, with a steep learning curve that would severely hinder community adoption if it were open-sourced. Here we present IllinoisGRMHD, which is an open-source, highly extensible rewrite of the original closed-source GRMHD code of the ILNR group. Reducing the learning curve was the primary focus of this rewrite, with the goal of facilitating community involvement in the code's use and development, as well as the minimization of human effort in generating new science. IllinoisGRMHD also saves computer time, generating roundoff-precision identical output to the original code on adaptive-mesh grids, but nearly twice as fast at scales of hundreds to thousands of cores.},

merges with a thermal core at low energies, as is characteristic of
observed particle spectra in collisionless plasmas. We provide fitting
formulae and error bounds on the fitting formulae for use in codes that
solve the radiative transfer equation. The numerical method and the
fitting formulae are implemented in a compact C library called symphony.
We find that the kappa distribution has a source function that is
indistinguishable from a thermal spectrum at low frequency and
transitions to the characteristic self-absorbed synchrotron spectrum,
{\textbackslash}propto \{ν \}5/2, at high frequency; the linear
polarization fraction for a thermal spectrum is near unity at high

The connection between black hole, accretion disk, and radio jet can be constrained best by fitting models to observations of nearby low-luminosity galactic nuclei, in particular the well-studied sources Sgr A* and M 87. There has been considerable progress in modeling the central engine of active galactic nuclei by an accreting supermassive black hole coupled to a relativistic plasma jet. However, can a single model be applied to a range of black hole masses and accretion rates? Aims: Here we want to compare the latest three-dimensional numerical model, originally developed for Sgr A* in the center of the Milky Way, to radio observations of the much more powerful and more massive black hole in M 87. Methods: We postprocess
three-dimensional GRMHD models of a jet-producing radiatively
inefficient accretion flow around a spinning black hole using
relativistic radiative transfer and ray-tracing to produce model spectra and images. As a key new ingredient in these models, we allow the proton-electron coupling in these simulations depend on the magnetic properties of the plasma. Results: We find that the radio emission in M 87 is described well by a combination of a two-temperature accretion flow and a hot single-temperature jet. Most of the radio emission in our simulations comes from the jet sheath. The model fits the basic observed characteristics of the M 87 radio core: it is "edge-brightened", starts subluminally, has a flat spectrum, and increases in size with wavelength. The best fit model has a
mass-accretion rate of Ṁ {\textasciitilde} 9 ×
10-3M⊙ yr-1 and a total jet power of Pj {\textasciitilde} 1043 erg s-1. Emission at λ = 1.3 mm is produced by the counter-jet close to the event
horizon. Its characteristic crescent shape surrounding the black hole shadow could be resolved by future millimeter-wave VLBI experiments. Conclusions: The model was successfully derived from one for the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way by appropriately scaling mass and accretion rate. This suggests the possibility that this model could also apply to a wider range of low-luminosity black holes.},

returning radiation that is deflected by the strong-field gravity of the BH and scatters off of the disk before reaching a distant observer. Although carrying a relatively small fraction of the total observed flux, the scattered radiation tends to be highly polarized and in a direction perpendicular to the direct radiation Agol \& Krolik. For moderately large spin parameters (a/M gsim 0.9), this scattered
returning radiation dominates the polarization signal at energies above the thermal peak, giving a net rotation in the polarization angle of 90°. We show how these new features of the polarization spectra from BHs in the thermal state may be developed into a powerful tool for measuring BH spin and probing the gas flow in the innermost disk. In addition to determining the emission profile, polarization observations can be used to constrain other properties of the system such as BH mass, inclination, and distance. New instruments currently under development should be able to exploit this tool in the near future.},

At a distance of 8 kpc (sime 2.5 × 1022 cm) the black hole would be among the largest black holes as judged by angular size. Recent observations are consistent with the idea that the
millimetre and sub-millimetre photons are dominated by optically thin, thermal synchrotron emission. Anticipating future Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations of Sgr A* at these wavelengths, we present here the first dynamically self-consistent models of millimetre and sub-millimetre emission from Sgr A* based on general relativistic numerical simulations of the accretion flow. Angle-dependent spectra are calculated assuming a thermal distribution of electrons at the baryonic temperature dictated by the simulation and the accretion rate, which acts as a free parameter in our model. The effects of varying model parameters (black hole spin and inclination of the spin to the line of sight) and source variability on the spectrum are shown. We find that the accretion rate value needed to match our calculated millimetre flux to the observed flux is consistent with constraints on the accretion rate inferred from detections of the rotation measure. We also describe the relativistic jet that is launched along the black hole spin axis by the accretion disc and evolves to scales of

	abstract = {We describe new optically thin solutions for rotating accretion flows around black holes and neutron stars. These solutions are advection dominated, so that most of the viscously dissipated energy is advected radially with the flow. We model the accreting gas as a two-temperature plasma and include cooling by bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and
Comptonization. We obtain electron temperatures Te
108.5-1010 K.

The new solutions are present only for mass accretion rates
Mṡcrit less than a critical rate A crit which we calculate as a function of radius R and viscosity parameter α. For Mṡ {\textless} Mṡcrit we show
that there are three equilibrium branches of solutions. One of the branches corresponds to a cool optically thick flow which is the well-known thin disk solution of Shakura \& Sunyaev Another branch corresponds to a hot optically thin flow, discovered originally by Shapiro, Lightman, \& Eardley (SLE). This solution is thermally
unstable. The third branch corresponds to our new advection-dominated solution. This solution is hotter and more optically thin than the SLE solution but is viscously and thermally stable. It is related to the ion torus model of Rees et al. and may potentially explain the hard X-ray and γ-ray emission from X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.

For Mṡ {\textless} Mṡcrit, our work
suggests that an accretion flow can choose between two distinct states, namely, the thin disk solution and the new advection-dominated solution, both of which are apparently stable. We argue that, in certain
circumstances, it is only the latter solution that is truly stable, and that a thin disk will spontaneously evaporate and convert itself into an advection-dominated flow. Even for Mṡcrit we suggest that a thin disk may evaporate partially so that a fraction of the accretion occurs via an advection-dominated hot corona. If these ideas are correct, then optically thin advection-dominated flows must be very widespread, possibly the most common form of sub-Eddington
accretion in black holes.

Our calculations indicate that advection-dominated accretion on black holes differs considerably from similar flows around neutron stars. The crucial physical difference, which has been mentioned previously in the literature, is that in the former the advected energy is lost into the hole, whereas in the latter it is thermalized and re-radiated at the stellar surface, thereby providing soft photons which can Compton-cool the accreting gas. We obtain Mṡcrit ∼
α2MṡEdd for accreting black
holes, independent of the black hole mass, whereas it is
∼0.1α2MṡEdd for neutron
stars. Advection-dominated accretion is therefore more likely to occur in accreting black holes, and these systems will be underluminous for their Mṡ because the bulk of the energy is advected into the hole rather than being radiated. We find that Te in accreting black hole flows rises up to ∼109
1010 K, compared to Te ∼
108.5-109 K in neutron star systems. Spectra of accreting black holes are therefore expected to be harder than those of accreting neutron stars. Pair effects are also more likely in black hole systems, though only at higher A than those we consider.},

The models simultaneously match the observed mm mean flux density, mm image size, NIR quiescent flux density, NIR flare flux density, and NIR spectral slope. They also provide a better fit to the observed NIR flux density probability density function than previously reported models by reproducing the power-law tail at high flux density, though with some discrepancy at low flux density.

	abstract = {As computational astrophysics comes under pressure to become a precision science, there is an increasing need to move to high accuracy schemes for computational astrophysics. The algorithmic needs of computational astrophysics are indeed very special. The methods need to be robust and preserve the positivity of density and pressure. Relativistic flows should remain sub-luminal. These requirements place additional pressures on a computational astrophysics code, which are usually not felt by a traditional fluid dynamics code. Hence the need for a specialized review. The focus here is on weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes and PNPM schemes. WENO schemes are higher order extensions of traditional second order finite volume schemes. At third order, they are most similar to piecewise parabolic method schemes, which are also included. DG schemes evolve all the moments of the solution, with the result that they are more accurate than WENO schemes. PNPM schemes occupy a compromise position between WENO and DG schemes. They evolve an Nth order spatial polynomial, while reconstructing higher order terms up to Mth order. As a result, the timestep can be larger. Time-dependent astrophysical codes need to be accurate in space and time with the result that the spatial and temporal accuracies must be matched. This is realized with the help of strong stability preserving Runge–Kutta schemes and ADER (Arbitrary DERivative in space and time) schemes, both of which are also described. The emphasis of this review is on computer-implementable ideas, not necessarily on the underlying theory.},

Inside the disruption radius, the gas accretes as discrete blobs or streams with a velocity much less than the free-fall velocity. Almost the entire rest mass energy of the gas is released as heat, radiation and mechanical/magnetic energy.

	abstract = {The manycore revolution can be characterized by increasing thread counts, decreasing memory per thread, and diversity of continually evolving manycore architectures. High performance computing (HPC) applications and libraries must exploit increasingly finer levels of parallelism within their codes to sustain scalability on these devices. A major obstacle to performance portability is the diverse and conflicting set of constraints on memory access patterns across devices. Contemporary portable programming models address manycore parallelism (e.g., OpenMP, OpenACC, OpenCL) but fail to address memory access patterns. The Kokkos C++ library enables applications and domain libraries to achieve performance portability on diverse manycore architectures by unifying abstractions for both fine-grain data parallelism and memory access patterns. In this paper we describe Kokkos’ abstractions, summarize its application programmer interface (API), present performance results for unit-test kernels and mini-applications, and outline an incremental strategy for migrating legacy C++ codes to Kokkos. The Kokkos library is under active research and development to incorporate capabilities from new generations of manycore architectures, and to address a growing list of applications and domain libraries.},

In many cases, the study of accretion disks has evolved from their inferred presence based on circumstantial evidence to direct imaging and detailed spectral analyses.

redistributed in accretion disks as a consequence of angular momentum transfer. The identification of the dominant process involved is an important task in the development of accretion disk theory. Here, we review recent theoretical investigations on several important physical processes, including: 1. the removal of angular momentum from disks through hydromagnetic winds, 2. the amplification of local viscous stress through the onset of turbulence resulting from possible
hydromagnetic, convective, or shear flow instabilities, 3. the transport of angular momentum carried by propagating waves, and 4. torque
resulting from the presence of nonaxisymmetric unstable modes in self-gravitating and geometrically thick disks. Because of the technical nature of this subject, we present some of the mathematical formalisms in a pedagogical manner. We focus our attention on the physical
discussion of the necessary conditions for each process to operate and the efficiency of angular momentum transfer to be expected. In Part II of this review, we shall present observational evidences and discuss applications of theoretical results in different astrophysical contexts.},

However, special effort is required to connect inflow dynamics (dependent largely on angular momentum transport) to radiation (dependent largely on thermodynamics and photon diffusion). To this end, we extend the flux-conservative, general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) code HARM from axisymmetry to full three dimensions. The use of an energy conserving algorithm allows the energy dissipated in the course of relativistic accretion to be captured as heat. The inclusion of a simple optically thin cooling function permits explicit control of the simulated disk's geometric thickness as well as a direct calculation of both the amplitude and location of the radiative cooling associated with the accretion stresses. Fully relativistic ray-tracing is used to compute the luminosity received by distant observers. For a disk with aspect ratio H/r ≃ 0.1 accreting onto a black hole with spin parameter a/M = 0.9, we find that there is significant dissipation beyond that predicted by the classical Novikov–Thorne model. However, much of it occurs deep in the potential, where photon capture and gravitational redshifting can strongly limit the net photon energy escaping to infinity. In addition, with these parameters and this radiation model, significant thermal and magnetic energy remains with the gas and is accreted by the black hole. In our model, the net luminosity reaching infinity is 6\% greater than the Novikov–Thorne prediction. If the accreted thermal energy were wholly radiated, the total luminosity of the accretion flow would be ≃20\% greater than the Novikov–Thorne value.},

	abstract = {We have simulated the magnetohydrodynamic evolution of a circumbinary disk surrounding an equal-mass binary comprising two non-spinning black holes during the period in which the disk inflow time is comparable to the binary evolution time due to gravitational radiation. Both the changing spacetime and the binary orbital evolution are described by an innovative technique utilizing high-order post-Newtonian approximations. Prior to the beginning of the inspiral, the structure of the
circumbinary disk is predicted well by extrapolation from Newtonian results: a gap of roughly two binary separation radii is cleared, and matter piles up at the outer edge of this gap as inflow is retarded by torques exerted by the binary; the accretion rate is roughly half its value at large radius. During inspiral, the inner edge of the disk initially moves inward in coordination with the shrinking binary, but—as the orbital evolution accelerates—the inward motion
of the disk edge falls behind the rate of binary compression. In this stage, the binary torque falls substantially, but the accretion rate decreases by only 10\%-20\%. When the binary separation is tens of gravitational radii, the rest-mass efficiency of disk radiation is a few percent, suggesting that supermassive binary black holes could be very luminous at this stage of their evolution. Inner disk heating is modulated at a beat frequency comparable to the binary orbital
frequency. However, a disk with sufficient surface density to be luminous may be optically thick, suppressing periodic modulation of the luminosity.},

multidimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems, having the
divergence-free relation and the related properties of the magnetic
field B as built-in conditions. Our approach mostly relies on the
constrained transport (CT) discretization technique for the magnetic
field components, originally developed for the linear induction
equation, which assures [∇.B]num=0 and its preservation
in time to within machine accuracy in a finite-volume setting. We show
that the CT formalism, when fully exploited, can be used as a general
guideline to design the reconstruction procedures of the B vector field,
to adapt standard upwind procedures for the momentum and energy
equations, avoiding the onset of numerical monopoles of O(1) size, and
to formulate approximate Riemann solvers for the induction equation.
This general framework will be named here upwind constrained transport
(UCT). To demonstrate the versatility of our method, we apply it to a
variety of schemes, which are finally validated numerically and
compared: a novel implementation for the MHD case of the second-order
Roe-type positive scheme by Liu and Lax [J. Comput. Fluid Dyn. 5 (1996)

solutions, allowing us to calculate errors and convergence rates for our
code. The Bondi problem only has an analytic solution when radiative
processes are ignored, but it is pertinent because it is closer to the
physics we ultimately want to study. In our simulations, we include
Thomson scattering and thermal bremsstrahlung in the opacity, focusing
exclusively on the super-Eddington regime. Unlike accretion onto bodies
with solid surfaces, super-Eddington accretion onto black holes does not
produce super-Eddington luminosity. In our examples, despite accreting

the extent to which general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)
simulations can be applied to observations of low-luminosity accreting
black holes. We present, implement, and test a model that
self-consistently evolves an entropy equation for the electrons and
takes into account the effects of spatially varying electron heating and
relativistic anisotropic thermal conduction along magnetic field lines.
We neglect the backreaction of electron pressure on the dynamics of the
accretion flow. Our model is appropriate for systems accreting at
≪10-5 of the Eddington accretion rate, so radiative
cooling by electrons can be neglected. It can be extended to higher
accretion rates in the future by including electron cooling and
proton-electron Coulomb collisions. We present a suite of tests showing
that our method recovers the correct solution for electron heating under
a range of circumstances, including strong shocks and driven turbulence.
Our initial applications to axisymmetric simulations of accreting black
holes show that (1) physically motivated electron heating rates that
depend on the local magnetic field strength yield electron temperature
distributions significantly different from the constant
electron-to-proton temperature ratios assumed in previous work, with
higher electron temperatures concentrated in the coronal region between
the disc and the jet; (2) electron thermal conduction significantly
modifies the electron temperature in the inner regions of black hole
accretion flows if the effective electron mean free path is larger than
the local scaleheight of the disc (at least for the initial conditions
and magnetic field configurations we study). The methods developed in
this work are important for producing more realistic predictions for the
emission from accreting black holes such as Sagittarius A* and M87;
these applications will be explored in future work.},

	abstract = {Accreting black holes (BHs) launch relativistic collimated jets, across 
many decades in luminosity and mass, suggesting the jet launching
mechanism is universal, robust, and scale-free. Theoretical models and
general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations indicate
that the key jet-making ingredient is large-scale poloidal magnetic
flux. However, its origin is uncertain, and it is unknown if it can be
generated in situ or dragged inward from the ambient medium. Here, we
use the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code H-AMR to study global 3D BH accretion
at unusually high resolutions more typical of local shearing box
simulations. We demonstrate that turbulence in a radially extended
accretion disc can generate large-scale poloidal magnetic flux in situ,
even when starting from a purely toroidal magnetic field. The flux
accumulates around the BH till it becomes dynamically important, leads
to a magnetically arrested disc (MAD), and launches relativistic jets
that are more powerful than the accretion flow. The jet power exceeds
that of previous GRMHD toroidal field simulations by a factor of 10 000.
The jets do not show significant kink or pinch instabilities, accelerate
to γ ∼ 10 over three decades in distance, and follow a
collimation profile similar to the observed M87 jet.},

	abstract = {Does overall thermal equilibrium exist between ions and electrons in a 
weakly collisional, magnetized, turbulent plasma? And, if not, how is
thermal energy partitioned between ions and electrons? This is a
fundamental question in plasma physics, the answer to which is also
crucial for predicting the properties of far-distant astronomical
objects such as accretion disks around black holes. In the context of
disks, this question was posed nearly two decades ago and has since
generated a sizeable literature. Here we provide the answer for the case
in which energy is injected into the plasma via Alfvénic
turbulence: Collisionless turbulent heating typically acts to
disequilibrate the ion and electron temperatures. Numerical simulations
using a hybrid fluid-gyrokinetic model indicate that the ion-electron
heating-rate ratio is an increasing function of the thermal-to-magnetic
energy ratio, βi: It ranges from ∼0.05 at βi=0.1 to at
least 30 for βi≳10. This energy partition is approximately
insensitive to the ion-to-electron temperature ratio Ti/Te. Thus, in the
absence of other equilibrating mechanisms, a collisionless plasma system
heated via Alfvénic turbulence will tend toward a nonequilibrium
state in which one of the species is significantly hotter than the
other, i.e., hotter ions at high βi and hotter electrons at low
βi. Spectra of electromagnetic fields and the ion distribution
function in 5D phase space exhibit an interesting new magnetically
dominated regime at high βi and a tendency for the ion heating to
be mediated by nonlinear phase mixing (“entropy cascade”)
when βi≲1 and by linear phase mixing (Landau damping) when
βi≫1.},

The observed rotation measure (RM) probes the density, magnetic field, and temperature of material integrated along the line of sight. To better understand how accretion disc conditions are reflected in the RM, we perform polarized radiative transfer calculations using a set of general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations appropriate for M87*. We find that in spatially resolved millimetre wavelength images on event horizon scales, the RM can vary by orders of magnitude and even flip sign. The observational consequences of this spatial structure include significant time-variability, sign-flips, and non-λ2 evolution of the polarization plane. For some models, we find that internal RM can cause significant bandwidth depolarization even across the relatively narrow fractional bandwidths observed by the EHT. We decompose the linearly polarized emission in these models based on their RM and find that emission in front of the mid-plane can exhibit orders of magnitude less Faraday rotation than emission originating from behind the
mid-plane or within the photon ring. We confirm that the spatially unresolved (i.e. image integrated) RM is a poor predictor of the accretion rate, with substantial scatter stemming from time variability and inclination effects. Models can be constrained with repeated observations to characterize time variability and the degree of
non-λ2 evolution of the polarization plane.},

Simulated images of black holes produced via general relativistic ray tracing and radiative transfer provide a key counterpart to these observational efforts. Black hole images have a wide range of physically interesting image structures, ranging from extremely fine scales in their lensed “photon rings” to the very large scales in their relativistic jets. The multiscale nature of the black hole system is therefore suitable for a multiscale approach to generate simulated images that capture all key elements of the system. Here, we present a prescription for adaptive ray tracing, which enables efficient computation of extremely high-resolution images of black holes. Using the polarized ray-tracing code ipole, we image a combination of semianalytic and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models, and we show that images can be reproduced with a mean squared error of less than 0.1\% even after tracing 12× fewer rays. We then use adaptive ray tracing to explore the properties of the photon ring. We illustrate the behavior of individual subrings in GRMHD simulations, and we explore their signatures in interferometric visibilities.},

Here, we present a GPU-accelerated GRMHD code H-AMR with multi-faceted optimizations that, collectively, accelerate computation by 2-5 orders of magnitude for a wide range of applications. Firstly, it involves a novel implementation of a spherical-polar grid with 3D adaptive mesh refinement that operates in each of the 3 dimensions independently. This allows us to circumvent the Courant condition near the polar singularity, which otherwise cripples high-res computational performance. Secondly, we demonstrate that local adaptive time-stepping (LAT) on a logarithmic spherical-polar grid accelerates computation by a factor of \${\textbackslash}lesssim10\$ compared to traditional hierarchical time-stepping approaches. Jointly, these unique features lead to an effective speed of \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}9\$ zone-cycles-per-second-per-node on 5,400 NVIDIA V100 GPUs (i.e., 900 nodes of the OLCF Summit supercomputer). We demonstrate its computational performance by presenting the first GRMHD simulation of a tilted thin accretion disk threaded by a toroidal magnetic field around a rapidly spinning black hole. With an effective resolution of \$13\$,\$440{\textbackslash}times4\$,\$608{\textbackslash}times8\$,\$092\$ cells, and a total of \${\textbackslash}lesssim22\$ billion cells and \${\textbackslash}sim0.65{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}8\$ timesteps, it is among the largest astrophysical simulations ever performed. We find that frame-dragging by the black hole tears up the disk into two independently precessing sub-disks. The innermost sub-disk rotation axis intermittently aligns with the black hole spin, demonstrating for the first time that such long-sought alignment is possible in the absence of large-scale poloidal magnetic fields.},

This paper details a new general image feature extraction technique that applies to a wide variety of VLBI image reconstructions called variational image domain analysis. Unlike previous tools, variational image domain analysis can be applied to any image reconstruction regardless of its structure. To demonstrate its flexibility, we analyze thousands of reconstructions from previous EHT synthetic datasets and recover image features such as diameter, orientation, and asymmetry. By measuring these features, VIDA can help extract astrophysically relevant quantities such as the mass and orientation of M 87.},

In order to understand the physical mechanisms involved in such systems, it is necessary to employ fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations able to include the effects of a composition and temperature dependent equation of state describing neutron star matter as well as neutrino emission and reabsorption. Here, we present our new code named Spritz that solves the GRMHD equations in 3D Cartesian coordinates and on a dynamical spacetime. The code can support tabulated equations of state, taking into account finite temperature effects and allowing for the inclusion of neutrino radiation. In this first paper, we present the general features of the code and a series of tests performed in special and general relativity to assess the robustness of the basic GRMHD algorithms implemented. Among these tests, we also present the first comparison between a non-staggered and a staggered formulation of the vector potential evolution, which is used to guarantee the divergence-less character of the magnetic field. With respect to other publicly available GRMHD codes, Spritz combines the robust approach of a staggered formulation of the vector potential together with the use of an equation of state driver (EOS\_Omni) that can allow the code to use finite temperature equations of state. A next version of the code will fully test the EOS\_Omni driver by coupling it with a neutrino leakage scheme.},
